<P>I went back to school after spending a week with Rae and Tim. Halimat missed me. Her parents kept asking me about my mom.
While Halimat and I were in our third year , her brother was in his finals.
"Guess what" Halimat said.
"What!! ,  you  know I'm not good at guessing"  I replied.
"My brother is planning a surprise birthday party for you"  she said smiling.
"Suprise what"   I screamed and fell on my bed.
"I didn't tell you anything" she said and we both laughed.
My birthday  date  happens to be the same date kadiri was graduating. What a great coincidence!!!. My birthday date hardly comes. I was  born February 29th , same reason my mom thought I was a blessing to her .
Preparations for both parties had started. Halimat was in charge. I still didn't want any distractions. I didn't take the birthday too serious. I was close to my finals and any mistake could be life threatening.
February 29th came quickly. And so the day came when I would say my final good bye to kadiri. Kadiri was already made. His dad made him in charge of two companies , meaning after Nysc there was no need looking for job like most Nigeria youth will do. I really envied him. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth tho.
I came to the party late because Halimat took a thousand years to get dressed. When I got there I took a seat beside kadiri. His parents were present at the party but they didn't stay long .  After kadiri's father prayed, he left and kadiri's mom followed.
We danced and danced .  There were lots of refreshment.  Kadiri spent more than 10 million on this particular party. Soon it was time to cut the cake. Kadiri and I were called upon to cut the cake. I led the way.
"At the spelling of Jesus  , you  will both cut the cake"  the m.c said.
"J-E-S-U-S"  the m.c announced stressing each letter.
"Jesus" we both cut the cake
There was an applause. When it was time to present gift I was told to present my gift first. I presented a big frame with his picture on it.
"Congratulations kadiri"  I said as I gave him the frame.
He smiled and  he gladly  took the frame from me .
"I love it" he said and I smiled.
When it was time for him to present my gift to me, he asked me to close my eyes. I did.
"Suprise" he said.
I opened my eyes and saw a  car key. We stayed in a warm embrace for a long time.
"Thank you " I managed to say with tears coming from my eyes.
I was going  to  miss  kadiri . The party finally came to an end. Guest had enough and still had extra to take home.
It was my final year in school . Halimat and I had to seat tight so we won't spend an extra year in school. We graduated without any carry over.
My mom was present at my graduation, Rae came. Kadiri was also present. I was always with kadiri  at the graduation .  Rae was jealous , I noticed it but choose to ignore. My mom, Rae and I came back to benin finally while Halimat and her brother stayed back in Lagos since their parents stayed there.
I seized the opportunity to introduce Rae to my mom properly. My mom welcome him and Rae told my mom  that he wanted me to stay with him. Mom didn't have any Choice buh to allow.</P>
