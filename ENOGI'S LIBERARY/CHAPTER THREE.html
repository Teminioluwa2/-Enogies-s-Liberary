<P>My night with Rae and Tim.
I changed from my dress into Rae's dress. It looked perfect on me buh it was kinda big.  Rae  just stood and was smiling at me. I blushed silently.
"Let's watch movie" I suggested.
They both agreed. I prepared pop corn in a basket and brought the popcorn to Rae's room. Rae's room was our Cinema.
" Turn off the light" I said .
"Why" Rae questioned.
"I don't like light when I'm watching movie" I answered.
"I'm not turning off the light" Rae Said.
I stood up and went to where  the switch was  and  turned it off myself. I went back to seat on the bed. Rae stood up and turned on the light. I went back to on the light. We continued fighting over the switch. Rae wrapped his hands around my waist.
" I love you Ella " he whispered.
I chuckled.
"Is that suppose to be the movie" Tim laughed as he stood up to off the light.
"Y-e-s" I shouted
They both looked at me and I behaved myself. We ended the movie and there was no moral lesson self.
"I'm  bored, why don't we go out" Tim said.
"It's late and we can't go out now. I checked the time and it was past 10pm .  Besides I  don't attend night parties" . I said.
"I bet you will enjoy it" Tim said
"Okkk....fine I'm in" I gave up.
I changed into my previous dress. I didn't apply any make - over because I wasn't having any . I packed my hair into style.
"I'm set" I told Rae and Tim.
We went to the club. I sat close to Rae while Tim went somewhere else. Though we could still see him , buh he wasn't close to us.
Rae played with my fingers. We danced buh didn't dance much. We chatted about so many things. Rae didn't want me to leave him. He was gonna miss me if leave for school and I knew it.
Rae placed a kiss on my lips.
"What did you do that for" I asked him.
" I love you" was all he said.
I looked round to ensure no one saw us buh it was too late because Rae had already kissed me.
"Hmm , I saw that" Tim said
I was shy now
Let's go please" I begged
We got home past 2am in the morning. Tim started telling us stories of how he slept with 2 girls. Within few hours , we stayed at that club he had slept with 2 ladies I thought within myself. I suddenly hated him. He took advantage of those ladies. I didn't like guys who took advantage of ladies. They reminded me of my dad. He  told us stories of him and his numerous ex . I wasn't even interested in the stories because I suddenly didn't like him .
"Wanna sleep now" I yawned
"Gud night darling"  Tim replied.
"I didn't ask you to reply me" I said within me.
"What did you say" he asked him.
"Sweet dreams bby" I replied almost immediately.
Thank God he didn't hear me.
"I love you" Rae told me
"I love you too" I replied as I pecked him.
