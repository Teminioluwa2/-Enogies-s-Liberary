<p>"Osarugue"..... I love that name. Just as the name implies God had really been my refuge .
      Mom was benin by tribe  .  Sometimes I imagined how she found her self dating a white man . whatever transpire between her and my dad was none of my business. I hated that man and nothing could change it.
       I was purely Benin. I mean I was born and bought up in Benin. My mom called me Osamudiamen which means the one God stands by.  Well sometimes, I wondered if I wasn't the opposite of what I was called. I mean considering all I went through in life was God really with  me or against me??.  That was why I prefer been Ella.
  "Ella we need to talk" mom said.
   "About what"I asked while eating.
"Everything ella. What you did was very wrong . you shouldn't have left Rae" mom was screaming.
At the mention of Rae ....I burst into tears
   "Its wasn't my fault"  I manage to say.
"You  should have given the situation different  thoughts"  mom walked out on me.
    Evening came quickly. It was past 10 and osarugue was sleeping.
"Ella I want to tell you about ur dad" she said wearing a sad face.
Suddenly I became interested.
"Ella , your dad and I met while I was secondary school. We dated for years and when it was time that we could get married both parents refused. His parents refused because I was a black and I was poor. On the other hand my dad said i couldn't get married to him because he didn't like the whites. I and your dad was confused....Both parents didn't conset so there was no way we could get married. Your father's mother threatened to arrest my mom if she sees me anywhere around her son. I love your dad no doubt but I just didn't love him enough to watch my mom suffer because of him".
She took a deep breath and continued.
    " I had to keep distance with your dad. We could barely talk . Soon he told me that his mom wanted him to travel out of the country. I cried my life that particular evening seeing that the only one I truly loved was leaving me. Two weeks before he traveled out of the country, I went to see him.  His parents weren't around and so it was an opportunity for me to spend the night with him. When I got home the next morning, my mom asked me where I was coming from , I lied that it was a vigil. Your father left the country" mom said crying.
I got up from my seat and went to console her.
"Mom it's not dad's fault then. I thought he abandoned us " I sighed.
      I couldn't cry because I had seen worst things in life and this was not the worst of them all .
"Few weeks after your father left the country , I discovered I was pregnant. I just couldn't tell anyone not even my mom. Somehow I told ur dad and he promised to send me  money from time to time  for  my  up keep. We continued like that and after giving birth to you, I managed to see my parents who welcomed me back home with Joy.  I  rented  a house with my parents support".
She paused and then continued.
     "Few months later....I lost both parents. I stopped hearing from your dad as his line were no longer reachable. I had to take care of you in penny. Being poor was an understatement. No one associated with me" mom said crying.
    "Mommy its Okkkk.....we could still find dad" I managed to console.
she cried more.
"Are you okay " I asked staring at her.
"Your father is dead" she was on the floor.
For the first time in a while real tears drop from my eyes.
"How ma-na-ge" I stammered
"Cancer of the blood" mom said still crying.
"When , how, I  mean why"I was confused
"He died a week ago"Mom replied.
"How I wished I knew all these"I thought within my self.
A/n: Ella west got a wrong perception about  her father. Hope you are enjoying the book?❤</p>
