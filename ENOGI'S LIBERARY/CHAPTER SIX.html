<p>*The next day*
I picked some few clothes and arrange them into my traveling bag. I intended  spending one week with Rae. I got to the bus park and was damn lucky. A Traveller had come down from the bus. I guessed he forgot something and it was even the last bus going to benin , it was my luck.  So I quickly occupied the space.  Imediately the bus started moving , I bowed my head and slept. I wasn't actually sleeping. Some how I was thinking of Rae and the bad way I treated him. Even though my dad was heartless but all men are not the same,  I thought within myself.
I got to benin by two in the afternoon  because I had left  Lagos  early. I saw an inscription that says, WELCOME TO THE ANCIENT CITY OF BENIN. This wasn't there when I left benin two years ago.
"Our government is trying" , I whispered to myself.
On my way,  I saw different cultural groups dancing . Well ,  I was surprised.
" What are they doing today" I asked an elderly woman who was sitting close to me.
"Festival of arts and culture.  It was initiated by the omo 'n' oba 'n' Edo and it's the first in Edo state" she replied calmly.
"Driver ,  alight" I shouted.
I came down from the bus and paid the driver his money.
The place where the event  took place was  called king's square. I saw masquerades . Some without legs , other without hands and their faces were scaring.  I took a seat because I was enjoying the scenario.  I  forgot why I came to benin.
After the prayers , the omo 'n' oba 'n' Edo was called upon to give the state his royal prayers and royal dance. I heard lots of stories about this Oba but  had never seen him . I heard no one looks at him in the eyes or less the person wants to go blind. I also heard he changes anyone who offends him into cockroach, lizard and even wall gecko . My grandma use to tell me that every Oba was a peace maker. she told me about the Oba who sacrificed his life for the sake of Benin kingdom.
 "These Oba are nice" I use to tell her then.
That's why when I saw this Oba I was excited to see him. I stood just to ensure I look at his face . When I noticed I was the only one standing , I sat down back.
The ceremony didn't want to come to an end.
"Rae must be worried now",  I guessed.
I took my phone to call him because I was too tired to get a taxi.
"Rae, I'm stucked" I said
"Anything?" he asked me
"Hmm , yes. Traffic jam and accident. The drivers said they can't move"  I just told a lie.
"I'm on my way" he ended the call
Arghh..... I sighed.
Within 30 minutes Rae had already arrived. He parked his car and came down.
"Where is the traffic and accident you were talking about" he asked.
"I wanted you to come pick me up yourself"  I smiled.
He pecked me and we both got into the car. We got to Rae's house and I saw a mansion. I wasn't expecting Rae to build a house as big as this.
"Rae , who owns this house"  I was still surprised.
"We"  Rae and Tim chroused.
I smiled at them. Tim helped me carry my bags into my room. I couldn't believe that I had my special room in his house. I  kept wondering  what the next seven days in Rae's house would be like.</p>
<p>A/n✨: Hope Ella and Rae settles their differences</p>
