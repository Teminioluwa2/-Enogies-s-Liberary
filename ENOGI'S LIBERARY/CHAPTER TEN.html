<p>Mom asked me to go back and stay with Rae . She also asked me to forget about everything so that it doesn't seem  I'm  desperate to have Rae. I went back and decided to act according to the words  of my mom.
"Where are you coming from and why  haven't you been picking my calls"  Rae asked.
"My mom wasn't feeling fine so I went to stay with her"  I lied.
"How is her health now"  Rae asked.
"She is better" I replied .
"I miss u bby"  that was Halimat
" I miss u more"  I replied as I hugged her.
I went into my room and accepted the fact that Rae wasn't going to propose.
Two weeks later , I came back from work and while I was resting , Rae came into my room.
"Babe ,  we are traveling out of the country by tomorrow. So pack your things"  he said placing my visa beside me.
"It's sudden" I protested.
"We don't have a choice. Our flight is scheduled for 10am tomorrow" he said lying on my bed.
Outwardly ,  I wasn't interested buh within me I loved the idea that I was traveling with Rae alone.
I woke up the next morning very early to tidy some stuffs. I also woke Rae. By 8am we were set. Halimat and Tim followed us to the airport.
"How long are you guys spending"  Tim asked.
"A week"  Rae replied.
We  chatted about so many things. Before Rae and I left , I hugged Halimat and Tim.
We got to New York and Rae booked a  hotel.
"Rae , this place is so cold and I won't spend more than 3 days"  I said as I laid on the bed.
"We are going for a date tomorrow"   Rae replied.
"Your own nor dey pass date"  I spoke our Nigeria pidigin.
Na u Sabi"  he replied back.
"Village boy"  I teased him.
I took my phone and called my mom to tell her I was in New York already. We talked about so many things before I finally ended the call. I called Halimat and I told her about the date. She lectured me on the dress  I was suppose to wear. Fashion was Halimat's thing. Babe like  fashion.
I woke up the next morning so I could get dress before Rae. I didn't want him to be waiting for me. I called Halimat again before leaving for the date. I told her I was nervous and she told me to put on my best smile.
Rae and I kept on greeting every white we saw till we got to the venue of the date. When we sat down, we ordered for wine.
"Tell me about the guy that bought you a car"  he said
"Ohhh , kadiri" I said
"I don't need his name" he said.
I could see jealousy in his eyes . I told him everything about kadiri and also told him that kadiri and Halimat were siblings.
"I understand"  was all he said after my long story.
The waitress brought apple and just as I opened my apple , I saw an engagement ring. I turned back to look at Rae and he was on his knees already.
"Marry me please" he begged.
"Yes !!! yes!!!"  I screamed and kissed him.
"I love you with all my heart"  he said passionately.
"I love you more"  I replied.
I came back to benin to show everyone who cared my engagement ring. My mom particularly was excited. Halimat and Tim congratulated me.
Wedding preparations had started because Tim and Rae planned to marry same day. I stayed at home this particular day because I had slight headache. Halimat went to the shop while Tim and Rae went to work.
While I was in my room resting. Tim walked into the room.
"Tim, why aren't you at work"  I asked
"Shhhh"he crossed his hands on my lips.
He slipped his hands under my dress and kissed me .
"Tim " , I was too weak to shout. I tried pushing him away buh he was too strong for me.
"Please , please don't do this" I begged.
"Some one please .......!!" I screamed buh had already lost my voice.
He raped me!!!</p>
