    I woke up very early and arranged my baggage .  Mom must not know about my new plan .  I needed  to be fast about it. Quickly I took my phone and dialed a friend's number.
Caller: who's on the line
"Ella west" I replied blunty.
"Hmmmm i'm in need of an accommodation in  Lagos state." I continued.
Finally, I was able to settle in Lagos state. Although the house was not too nice but I had to manage it. I started a tailoring business where I planned to  save some money to  travel out of the country.
      I  changed my line and changed all my social media account. I just didn't want to have  anything to do with anyone associated with my past . Two  months later, I got a contract with a famous fashion house where I was awarded  the sum of 1.5million and a car. I sold the car and added the money to the one I already had.  Prepared my visa and left the country. It wasn't easy but I struggled and fought for my self. I was not gonna be the one who would cause  eternal hatred between Tim and Rae.
   I got a house in the united kingdom where I worked as a maid. The family I lived with were extremely nice so I told them everything that happened during my stay in Nigeria.  Mrs Brown the woman I stay with advised me to call my mom. Thank God I knew mom's number off hand.
"Hey mom"I screamed on the phone
"Ella .....where have you been , what happened"?? she sobered
      "Mom please don't cry...I will give birth anytime soon and come back to the country" I managed to say with tears in my eyes.
We chatted about few things but didn't talk about Rae.
      Back here in UK I was extremely nice to Mr and Mrs Brown my new parents. They sponsored my anti natal  and didn't allow me do much work. They treated me like their child.
    Ninth month came  and  I anticipated my delivery. I started series of frustrating exercise.  I gave birth to a bouncing baby boy which looked some much like Tim but reminded me of Rae. I was happy because I had a child who was a citizen of united kingdom. I told Mr and Mrs Brown that I would love to go back to my country and give my baby to my mom. They welcomed the decision and promised to visit me in Nigeria.
      Six months after I gave birth, I came back to Benin. I miss my "ancient city". I had difficulty locating my mom's house. OMG!!! It's  actually a year plus and I had  forgotten most things. " My memory"  I said tapping my head. I had made up my mind to pay mom a surprise visit and I wasn't gonna ruin it by  calling and asking her for direction.
I knew I was in the street so I started asking for directions. I saw my house and I  remember vididly our house , the gate and the oranmental flowers. I quickly opened the gate.
"Mommy " I screamed
  Mom came down immediately and she quickly carried her  grand child. I smiled and hugged her. I had missed her.
"What is his name" mom asked looking at her grandchild.
"No name yet o" I shrugged
"We shall call him OSARUGUE .....God is our refuge"  mom smiled.
"O-s-a-r-u-g-u-e" I repeated after mom </p>
