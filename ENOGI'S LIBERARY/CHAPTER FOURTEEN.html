<p>I woke up the next morning very early. I couldn't sleep. Somehow I was beginning to miss my father even though I didn't see him once even in death. Well it passed. I managed to do all the house chores. I was preparing breakfast when mom walked in.
   "Aren't  you going to see Rae" she asked opening the fridge.
    "Not now" I replied almost immediately and she smiled.
          Life was going back to normal. I had partially forgotten about my dad. Rae wasn't in my mind at all. My son was 2 years old and my mom was hale and hearty. These two were all that mattered to me. I built a house where my baby , mom and I lived. I  also had a car. My baby was just too young to start school so looking for a school was not a problem.
    I went shopping on this particular day to get our monthly foodstuffs .
   "Ella " someone screamed my name
I turned around and saw Tim. "What was he doing here" I asked myself.
"Hey" I managed to say.
"Ella....where have you been. I have looked for an opportunity to say  sorry but I didn't get any . I am sorry Ella" Tim pleaded .
"You are forgiven. Its past. where is halimat and Rae"??.  I managed to ask.
"Ella can we just go out on a date and I will tell u all that happened" he pleaded.
"Hmm...sure...I'll think about it". I blunted.
We exchanged cards and went our separate ways. When I got home ....I told mom about it and she advised me  to take the date seriously. I wasn't going to tell him that I had a child because I didn't want him to reap where he didn't sow.
When I got to the place , I called him and he told me that he had booked a seat. Tim was really hot this time. He got a  soft spot, he was  cute and handsome.
"Hmm"......Tim broke the silence.
"Tell me everything" I demanded.
   "I no longer stay with Rae and I canceled my engagement with halimat". Tim was sad.
"Why" I could feel guilt in his eyes.
"I couldn't forgive my self .  I found out that I betrayed everyone"  he sobered.
"Did you tell them"I asked .
"No" he replied.
"Ohhh....poor halimat . she must had passed through a lot" I sighed.
"I'm telling them soon" Tim blunted.
I pretended I didn't hear that one . It was his business.
"You have a child and don't pretend about it"  he said.
"And so" I retorted.
"The child is mine " he grinned.
"I beg to take my leave" I said standing up.
       Date was over. I told mom everything and she didn't comment.
    Mom's phone buzzed.
"Ella help me check my phone" Mom commanded.
It was a text message
Unknown number: Gud evening Ma, Hope you are fine. I and my entire family are inviting you and your daughter for a meeting. It would be of  great joy if you honor my invitation. Thanks
Tim.
