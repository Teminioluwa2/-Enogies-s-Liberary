<P>Few weeks after I started dating Rae , I got admission into the University of  Lagos . I was excited because it was my dream school. I called Rae to tell him. He was sad and I understood his point.
"Babe , don't you think it's time we meet??" Rae asked when I called him
"Yes, I thought of that" I replied sharply.
So we fixed our meeting date on a Saturday. I took permission from my mom  and she allowed buh insisted I come back home on time. I was set . I wore a pink gown. I got to the venue late. By the time I got there , Rae and his cousin brother Tim were seated.
"Sorry I came late, I had difficulty locating this place" I quickly apologized.
"No qualms" Tim spoke
So he spoke slangs. I was surprised because here in Nigeria slangs are mainly for touts.
"My manners , please have your seat" Rae offered me a seat next to him. Tim left us.
"You are beautiful" Rae whispered in my ears.
"Thanks" I managed to say.
We chatted about so many things. I told him I wanted to go home. We left.
I spent more time with Rae since I was going to school soon . We spent more days together.
One evening , Rae called me phone.
" Babe, I need to tell you something very important" , he said.
" Buh I just left your hux" I complained.
"It's urgent".....he started coughing
"I'm on my way" I ended the call and started running to his house
I got to his house and met him watching movie. He could be tricky sometimes I thought.
"Rae , you scared me" I said
" Sorry I did. I want to tell you something .
"What that"I asked
"Hmm..... I know you will be going to school anytime from now. You know when most Nigeria girls go to the  university  they forget about their boyfriend. I don't want our case to be like that. I can't stand the thought of losing you so I was thinking if you will allow me defile you. I know you are still a" ........
He paused.
"Rae, I pronounced his name softly staring into his eyes. I love you so much and I won't cheat you. I can't sleep with you". I have vowed  to keep my virginity till marriage. I don't want to suffer what my mom suffered.  I beg to take my leave now" I said standing .
Rae noticed my mood and said something I didn't hear. As I stepped out of the house, I saw Tim coming in.
"Wifey, That was the name Tim normally calls me. He noticed I wasn't smiling.
"Did you two have a fight" he asked
"No" I said crying now.
Tim hugged me and took me back inside.
"I'm sorry Ella" Rae managed to say
Tim said so many things and I laughed.
"Why don't you spend the night with us" Tim said.
"Hmm....okkk. let me call my mom" I sighed.
I took my phone and called my mom telling her I won't be around. She didn't complain. She just told me to come back home on time the next day.
"Thanks Mom" I shouted on my phone
"Rare gem" I whispered as I dropped my phone.
