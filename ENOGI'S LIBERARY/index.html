      <p>I woke up because Tim was singing. He was making noise and I needed a peaceful sleep. My day at work was really hectic. It's past 2am and one human being was singing instead of sleeping, lyrics he doesn't even know. Tim kept on singing. I hated the fact that I was been married to him. I never liked him. I was stucked in this annoying marriage. Yes,  I could have divorced him but my mom didn't want to hear of it. I hate Tim.
"Tim, my baby is sleeping" I said facing him.
He kept on singing.
"Tim, you are disturbing me" I screamed.
Tim stopped singing and was staring at the ceiling now. Was I treatly him bad? I asked myself. Whatsoever he is facing now, he caused it. He stole me from the one I truly loved.
Anyways.... lemme introduce myself briefly. I'm Ella West. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. My dad left my mom when he found out that my mom was pregnant. My mom raised me up all alone and she did everything to make me happy.
Being an only child, I enjoyed so many benefits. I got everything I wanted. At 16, I had my first boyfriend. I didn't like him much buh I was dating him. Well, that was because my friends wanted me to because the guy was rich. Even though I knew he was trying his best to make me happy I cared less.
We always had fights because I never agreed on his suggestions. After a year of dating, we broke up.
At 16, I was done with secondary school and I was waiting for admission into the university. I must make my mom proud. She had suffered a lot because of me. For 16 years of my life I didn't care who my father was. My friends did ask but I told them he was dead. Yes he was dead to me because he was heartless.
3 months after breaking up with my first boyfriend I met Rae. Rae became my Facebook bestie. We chatted like every normal friends. I haven't seen him once in real life but I had little feelings for him.
I came back from church one evening to see a Text message on my phone.
Rae💜: "I love you so much and I was thinking if we could be more than friends".
I blushed at seeing the text. My dreams of dating Rae had finally come to pass. I took my phone and typed YES. What was gonna happen next I wondered. I smiled and wasn't even conscious of the fact that my mom was staring
"Why are you smiling" my mom asked feigning annoyance.
"Hmmmm... nothing" I had to pretend.
I and Rae started dating even without seeing each other. He told me so much about his cousin , Tim. I hoped within me that I meet them both. I prayed that Rae shouldn't be like my dad.
