    <p>We didn't talk much about why I hadn't  been talking to him. We just went back to the normal lovers we use to be . His house wasn't neat so   I  had to help him  tidy up his house and wash his clothes. When I was done I prepared his food. After food, we all went to watch movie.
    "Babe, we will be going for a dinner date tomorrow"  Rae said.
    "Your own nor dey pass dinner date" I murmured.
    Thank God he didn't hear me. I went to my room to look for clothes. I arranged the necessary. After taking my bath , Rae came into my room and I was still on towels. He kissed my lips down to my neck. He kept kissing me till we both  feel  on  the  bed and the rest  was history .
    The next day came earlier than I expected. I couldn't understand what happened the previous night. I checked the bed sheets and there was no blood stains.
    "Thank God , I'm safe"  I did the sign on the cross. I got down from the bed to prepare for my today's date. I woke Rae up and he went to his room probably to sleep back. I did my house chores before taking my bath.
    I  wore a pink flowing gowns and wore a black heels. I packed my hair into styles and applied a  little make - over. I took my time to walk because I was wearing heels.
    "You're beautiful"  Tim said.
    "Thanks" I blushed.
    "After you"  Rae said.  I took the lead and we drove in Tim's car.
    We got to club  and  had fun. After enjoying at the club , Rae suggested we go to a beach.  On getting to the beach. We looked for a comfortable place and  laid on the sand. Tim wasn't with us and I actually pitied him.
    "Why don't he has a girlfriend" I  asked Rae.
    "My brother is a player and he doesn't need a serious relationship for the now"  Rae  replied and I laughed.
    I was lying on Rae.
    "Babe, I want to ask you something"  Rae said.
    "What"  I said
    "Will you marry me??"   he asked with a pleading eye.
    I quickly checked  to ensure there was no ring in his hands.  I was relieved when I didn't see any ring. Not like I didn't want to say yes buh I wasn't prepared at the moment.
    "Rae, I will marry you but  not now. I need to be done with my studies before I say yes" I kissed him on his lips and he kissed me back.
    Although, he was Moody buh I didn't want to bother myself. I was almost in my finals and I didn't want any distractions.
    Tim came into my room that evening and was staring at me. I looked back at him.
    "Why don't you want to marry my brother" he finally  said.
    I haven't said I won't marry him. I just need some time"  I replied.
    "If you don't love him why don't you tell him . If you are interested in some one else , why don't let him  Know"....he was yelling at me.
    My eyes were full of tears. I couldn't hold back  the tears . I just allowed them flow. Tim saw I was crying and he hugged me.
    "I'm sorry for raising my voice on you" he apologized.
    I placed my head on his chest and closed  my eyes. After a while, Tim pecked me on my forehead.
    "I didn't mean to offend you" he whispered into my ears as he left the room.</p>
    <p>A/n✨: Are you thinking what I'm thinking.</p>
    <p>Tim loves Ella😍</p>
