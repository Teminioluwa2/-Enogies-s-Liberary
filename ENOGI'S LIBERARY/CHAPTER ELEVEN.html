"I'm so dead ...... Argh... How do I explain things to Rae. What do I tell Halimat" I larmented.
        Suicide! Suicide!! Suicide!!!  Was all that ran through my mind. Quickly I took my phone and called my mom. I just had to behave myself so she doesn't suspect anything.
    Mom: "sweetheart , How are you ....How is Rae and every other person"?
     I heard Rae and couldn't control my tears. Mom was good at asking questions. That was one of the aspect  I didn't like about her
     "Mom I am finished.....I am dead...I can't possibly be living" I sobered
   Mom: "Is anything the matter. Are u okay??. Did you and Rae have a fight"??.
    Mom kept on asking millions of questions that I could not respond to. All I heard at the end of the phone  call  was come home so we could talk.
       Tim had left the house immediately after the ugly incident. I packed all my belongings as I was not gonna come back to the house. I forfeited my marriage , everything I had worked for years to build.
      Once again , As  I was leaving I took a final stare at the house which once gave me joy and I couldn't hold back my tears.
       "Big madam , where you dey go with all these big bag"....That was the gateman.
    "I wan go see my mom. When oga come tell am say I go buy something I dey come" I smiled as I dipped my hands into my hand bag to give him some money.
"Big madam I like you well well o. Oga is lucky to have you" he smiled.
    I laughed because I didn't want him to suspect anything and even the English he spoke didn't suit him .  I got a taxi and headed straight to my mom's house.
  "What did you say on the phone" my mom didn't even allow me drop my bags.
   I narrated everything to her and she was obviously angry with Tim. She asked me to go back and explain everything to Rae .  I knew it was an impossible mission.
        Morning came quickly and I thought of how to explain to Rae. I gat an idea. While I was with Rae I gathered some money so I decided to travel out of the country. My mom must not know of my silly idea. I smiled to myself.
   Few months later I found out that I was pregnant. Now I needed to excute my evil agenda. No one must find out.
    Wait!!!.....where do I start from.</p>
