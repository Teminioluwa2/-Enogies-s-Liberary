<p>THE RECONCILATION
  Osarugue , mom and I dressed the traditional style. While mom and I tied two wrappers on a blouse.  Osarugue wore complete native. Maybe we arrived the venue late or the people just didn't sleep at home. To me it was arranged, irrespective of the elders as soon as I sighted Halimat I ran to hug her. We exchange pleasantries and I shook hands with Rae.
"Reunion" I sighed.
I sat close to my mom and my son.
"My son , you called for  the meeting . can you tell us why" An elder spoke.
"Ehhn" he cleared his throat and continued.
  "First I want to apologize to the love of my life , and the mother of my child for everything I caused" he continued.
Who told him I had a child. I rolled my eyes 360 degrees and wished he was not referring to me. I turned to look at halimat but she was not with a child. Maybe she left the child with a nanny or something  I thought.  I wondered who he called Loml. Hope he was  not referring to me.
"Idiot" I cursed silently.
'' To my brother Rae , I am deeply and genuinely sorry" he  continued.
"You have not said any reasonable thing" another elder screamed.
"I tire o" The crowd murmured.
   "Seven years ago, my brother bought a girl as his girlfriend. Somehow I was beginning to like the girl but I knew my brother loved her and I didn't want to pose a threat on their relationship. As time went on , I couldn't control the urge. And so I pretended I was drunk just to rape her. Few months after the incident I knew she carried my child because my instincts told me so and so called off my original wedding" He concluded.
"You are evil" Rae grabbed him by the neck. "So you knew why Ella left and you kept it" Rae continued.
"I'm sorry " Tim cried.
I stood fixed so  Tim raped me on purpose.
"Hope you didn't go through a lot "?? halimat said as she hugged me.
"Was that why you left the house" Rae asked.
Yes, I just couldn't tell anyone" Tim said still crying.
Tim begged his brother and halimat . Although they both forgave him but it was after much please from the full crowd. I was happy things ended that way even though still angry.
"What about the son and his mother" Another  elder spoke.
"Which son " I screamed. "If I had known that it was this rubbish that made you call me , I wouldn't have been present" I hissed.
"Young lady, you have insulted everyone and you will be fined. You are to bring two tubers of yam" . The oldest man said.
I laughed and my mom spoke on my behalf. These people didn't know me.
At the end of the useless meeting, I was asked to move in with Tim after he paid the bride price. How I wished Tim never  paid  any bride price.
   Soon , Tim paid the bride price and  I was reluctant to live with him.  Mom said there was no room for divorce.
  Tim I will show you pepper. We moved into our house and my first assignment for Tim was to take care of our baby. Tim did most of the washing and cleaning of the house....he even deserved worst punishment. Maybe that was why he was singing late in the night.
      Back to the beginning
"Tim go back to sleep and don't wake my baby " I warned.
But it was too late, the baby had woken up. I took  a wrapper and gave it to Tim.
"Put him on ur back "I commanded.
"Shey you  are looking for marriage , you haven't seen anything"  I continued.
I left his room to spend my night in the living room.
A/n : Three more chapters to go and I am done with broken vows.....ya me!!😍</p>
