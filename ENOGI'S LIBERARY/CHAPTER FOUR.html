  <p>I was set for school. My mom had helped me arrange my things the previous night.
"Mom what about my corn flakes" I asked with a puppy face.
"It's in the Blue bag " my mom said.
I had to dress in the simplest way ever because I was going to school. I applied a little make - over and my mom helped me arrange my hair into styles. Those university lecturer wouldn't want to take trash as dressing. I sighed .
"Ella , don't forget to show them who you are" my mom said.
"I love you Mom" was all I said.
We got to the bus park exactly 8am. When we got there, our bus wasn't ready. My mom and I chatted about Rae  and she teased me about him. Rae didn't follow me to the park because he needed to be in work. It pained me tho.
At 10am , The bus was set to leave the  ancient city of Benin. I was gonna miss my City and it's stories. My mom waited until the bus Left.
Before leaving her , I waved her and she waved back. That moment I saw tears in her eyes. I missed her.
"Mom , I won't let you down"  I  said silently to my self.
At about 4pm , I got to the University of Lagos . I smiled within my self. I took my phone to call my mom
"Mom, I'm in school already" I shouted.
"Take care of yourself. Ensure you concentrate on your studies and above all be prayerful .  Don't  look down on your elders.  Don't  argue with any lecturer"  ......... She continued.
My ears were full. She had given me enough advice and words of wisdom before I left benin. I was fed up.
"Mom.... I cut her short. Have heard you. I will call you back when I find my hostel" I said .
The people here in Lagos were friendly. I didn't have any problem looking for directions. When I found my hostel I called my mom to tell her I had seen my room.
I sat on my bed reading my diary when I saw a place that reminded me of Rae. I had called him the previous night but not today. I took my phone and called him.
"Haba , you didn't even bother to call me" I said pretending annoyance.
Sorry babe , I felt u will be busy" he said
"Yeah, I was buh you should have still called" I continued.
He laughed. I guess he knew I was just looking for his trouble. We talked about so many things. I told him how friendly the people of Lagos  were. We talked for hours before I ended the call. I went back to reading my diary. I miss him so much.
"Hello, is anyone in" I heard someone say.
"Come in" I replied friendly
"I was told this is my room" she said
"Ohhh, we are roommates I guess"
"My name is Halimat" she introduce
"I'm Ella" I said.
After exchanging pleasantries, we took a stroll round the school's environment. We laughed over so many things. At a point , we almost got missing buh some how we managed to find our way back to the school's hostel.
Halimat was the nicest person I had met. Her parents treated me like their daughter. Halimat also had an elder brother called kadiri.
I was beginning to crush on kadiri.
