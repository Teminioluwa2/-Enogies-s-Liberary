<p>NYSC LOADING.....
I moved my belongings into Rae's house while I was waiting for Nysc. I told Rae I was bored staying at home all day and he  opened a shopping mall for me. Ralla was the name of the shopping mall. It sounds french buh it was a combination of our name. We had a joint account. Rae still made me in charge.
Nysc came and I was posted to kaduna . I took the print out and showed it to Rae.
"I don't like this"  he said
"Hmm.... Rae there is nothing I can do.  I don't have money for redeployment. Besides it's just 2 years and I will be back" I said softly
"You will fill a redeployment form" he said angrily and walked out on me.
"What  is doing him self ,  I'm I the one in charge" I sighed.
True to Rae's word, I was redeployed back to benin. The school I was teaching wasn't far from Rae's house and since I had a car I didn't stress myself that much. I normally close from work by 2 . I will go to the shopping mall first before going home. I had some one who was working in the mall from 8am till 2pm. She was paid tho. So you see that it was not stressful.
I came back one evening famished. The principal of the school where I worked asked me to stay back after my closing hours.
"Sweetheart , is there any food in the house" I asked Rae  as I drank a bottle of water.
"No"  , he replied smiling.
"Why are you smiling"  I asked him.
"We have a surprise for"he said
"We" I thought within me.
Just then Tim came in with Halimat.
"Halimat"  I screamed her name as I ran to hug her.
"Ella " she screamed back.
"What are you doing here" I asked
"I came to stay with my boyfriend. Since he is not staying too far from the school where I teach"  she replied.
"Your boyfriend.... I stressed. Don't tell me you are dating Tim"  I said opening my eyes wide.
"You too know each other"
she asked.
"Meet Rae, my boyfriend"  I introduce Rae.
"Nice meeting you , Ella has told me so much about you and I'm glad I'm meeting you in person."  She concluded.
I helped Halimat move her things into Tim's room.  So now , I had a pattern who will help me with the numerous house chores.
"Please help me prepare lunch"  I had started giving order.
"Madam " Rae teased.
Rae , Tim , Halimat and I went places together. Halimat and I were now the owners of the shopping mall in addition to our teaching job .  The name didn't change but we change account. It was no longer Rae and I account buh I and Halimat account.
Soon, 2 years was over and Nysc was over. I couldn't wait for Rae to pop the question. After the Nysc, I only had the shopping mall business because I didn't want to teach. I got home one evening  and started perceiving  aroma of a  delicious meal.
"To what do we own this delicious meal"  I asked while eating.
"Surprise .  Halimat showed me a ring on her middle finger. Tim  propose"  she said.
"Congratulations"  I said and went into my room to cry my eyes out.
I was happy buh still sad. Rae didn't want to propose to me anymore. I was Angry with Rae. I didn't want to talk to him anymore.
I left his house to stay with my mom.</p>
