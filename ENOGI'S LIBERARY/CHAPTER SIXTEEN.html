<p> Tim opened a shopping mall for me. It wasn't as big as the one I had before but I had to managed it. I normally resumed work 8am and then closed by 6pm. While Tim worked in an oil company though he didn't earn much. He resumed  work 7am and then close by 4pm. My child had also started school. Though he was in creche , Tim was in charge of the school runs. Tim picks him and brings him to my shopping mall before going back to work.
        That was my family and that was how we lived. Most times, I thought Tim was not suffering enough tho. I came back from  work one Saturday tired. I purposely stayed late to trouble Tim.
   "Tim , why haven't you wash the clothes . At least today is a work free day for you. You should make yourself useful in this house"  I stormed out of him.
    I knew his reaction. He looked so depressed. I smiled to myself. I went into the kitchen to continue my trouble.
"Tim ,Tim , Tim o"  I screamed for a third time.
"Yes"  he came almost immediately.
   "What is even your usefulness, I keep asking my self. Why haven't you prepared Dinner??. Who do you want to wash the dishes?!. Before I come back , I don't want to meet this house like this" I stormed out for a second time.
      I knew Tim wasn't happy with my behaviors  but seriously I don't give a damn. He stole me from the one I truly loved and I had promised to make him regret all the days of his life. I didn't have anywhere going. I Jux needed to leave the house  so I decided to take a tour taking my son along.
I got home past 8pm because there was a slight traffic jam on the way. On getting home I met my mom.
  "Mommy" I screamed as I ran to hug her.
"Where have you been" she said without looking me.
"I went out with my son" I replied bluntly.
       Mom looked at me with some kind of eye. Trust African parents. I understood the eye and I knew something was definitely wrong. I took my baby to his room because he was fast asleep. I went back to the visitor room where mom was because I knew she definitely had something to say.
"Mom , what's the matter " I asked sitting beside her.
"Ella, you are maltreating Tim and you know it. Why do you find it difficult to bury the past" mom said.
  "Mommy , I didn't Maltreat him o. Jux to wash and cook is dat maltreating. Mom if not for the nature of my job I would be doing all these myself" I smiled.
"Ella , it's family first. If you don't change someday you will regret your actions . I want to sleep . Gud night" mom said as she lay to sleep.
Actually, the last Words of mom touched me. Deep down , I wanted to change but something still told me that Tim had not suffered enough.
"Tim, you haven't seen anything" I stood up as I left mom's  room.
