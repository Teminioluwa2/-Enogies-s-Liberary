  <p>Halimat and I became besties. We went everywhere together. We attended classes together because we were offering the same course. My nickname for Halimat was Bestie T. The  T means  trouble.  In turn  She  called me puppy because she said I had these babyish face.
It was my second year in school. I hadn't gone back to benin  since the  time I left. I had partially forgotten about Rae buh I still called Mom on phone.  Halimat  parents treated me like their child and I was happy. I spent most of my holidays and strike Break with Halimat and her family. I called Mom to tell her about my new family and she was excited. She prayed for Halimat and her parents.
Second semester  holiday  came quickly. Halimat and I packed our baggages and went to her parents house.  Her mom and her brother welcomed us whole heartedly.
When it was time for dinner, I joined Halimat's mom and we both prepared dinner since cooking was my thing.
"Why don't we just give them their own house. They aren't babies any more"  kadiri said while we were eating on the dinner table.
"Hmm , I thought of that darling" her mom said facing her dad.
"Okkk....by tomorrow" her dad smiled.
I was excited within me. Halimat's parent were wealthy. Just as he promised, Halimat's dad gave us a house key. It wasn't the normal student house. We were leaving in mansion. Halimat and I shared one car. Everyday I gave my mom new set of gist.
Kadiri wasn't staying with us. Though he had a room in the House buh he doesn't  normally comes for visit . It was Saturday and  he had  come to see his sister as usual.
"Little sis", He said pecking Halimat on her forehead.
I was envious. I didn't even have any sibling not to talk of a brother. I left them and went into my room.
"Puppy ,  kadiri wants  to see you" Halimat said
"Why" I asked
" Dunno" she chuckled
She smiled and left the room. I went into kadiri's room and was a bit nervous. "What was he going to tell me??" I thought within myself.
Kadiri's room was kinda dark. Infact it was worth it because he barely stays in the room. I loved the scent of the room.
I sat on the couch still staring at the ceiling.
"Ella" he pronounced my name softly.
"You sent for me" I said.
"Yea I did, I love you Ella and I know I will make a good home with you. Ella we have been friends for more than 2 years and I want to make a perfect relationship with you. I promise to take care of you".
I was speechless.
"I have a boyfriend and I can't cheat on him".  I said and walked away from him.
He bowed his head.
I suddenly remembered that I had a boyfriend. What was wrong with me. Why did I stopped talking to Rae. I just couldn't figure out. I felt bad on how I had treated Rae. I blocked his number without any reason. I took my phone  unblock and called him.
"Rae , can I come   see you" I said crying.
"Why are you crying??, what happened to your phone??. Where have you been??"  . He was asking me millions of questions that I couldn't even answer
"I need your address" I was still crying.
I ended the call  and a text message came into my phone.
